## Playing with Markdown

I am *attempting* to familiarize myself with the basics of working from the
command line in Unix.  I am a programming student, and all of my learning to
this point in time has been in **IDEs**. I'm *super excited* to dig deeper
into the tools available to me and to design my own ideal coding environment!

Languages:
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bash

Short Term Goals
1. Familiarize myself with the Unix command line
2. Start using Git and Markdown
3. Find a good text editor
4. Set up a custom development environment from the command line
